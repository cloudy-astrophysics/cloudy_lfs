# This file specifies a series of continuum bands.  The code
# will find the total line and continuum emission by integrating over
# each band and will enter the intensity or luminosity as a "line" in
# the list of emission lines in the main output.
# This is a simple sum of the energy emitted between the low and high
# limits of the bands and assumes a uniform transmission function. 
#
# MAGIC NUMBER above is a version number and must appear as the first line - 
# it is used to confirm that this is the correct file

# 
# N.B. THIS FILE MUST BE KEPT PARALLEL WITH DOCUMENTATION
# table of bands is given in Part 2 of Hazy, in chapter lines.doc "the emission lines"
# section Continua under "the main emission-line printout" 
#
# LINE FORMAT
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Each line that does not begin with a # must 
# fully specify an entry into the emission-line stack.
# The "intensity" of the entry will the the total intensity or luminosity
# integrated over the band defined on the line.
# The first four characters are a label that identifies
# the integrated intensity in the output. It appears as the "line label"
# in the main output
#
# The 5th char must be a space
#
# The first number is the mean wavelength of the band and will appear
# as the "line wavelength" in the printout.
# It must be given in microns
#
# The remaining two numbers are the lower and upper wavelength range
# for the integration, must be given in microns.
# All numbers must be greater than 0 and the third number must be 
# larger than the second.
#
# EXAMPLE
# LABL wl  wl1  wl2
# where LABL is the 4 char label that will appear in the emission-line stack
# wl is the wavelength that will appear in the stack
# wl1 and wl2 are the lower and upper bounds to the band
#
# NB ALL WAVELENGTHS *MUST* BE IN MICRONS
#
# Any line with a "#" in col 1 is a comment and totally ignored,
# These comment lines can occur anywhere within this file.
#
# The number of wavelength bands is deduced on the fly by reading this file.
# There is no limit to the number of bands in this file.
#
# The file ends with end of file, and must contain comments or valid data
# up to that point
#
# the order of the bands in this file is arbitrary,
# and the bands will appear in exactly this order in the standard printout
#
# the variables used to do these bands in the code are

# DEFINE PAH EMISSION BANDS HERE 
# PAHC is the continuum associated with the various PAH features
# NB - NA adjusted these bands so that the continuum can be removed from the PAH energy
# to do this the number of continuum cells must equal the number of cells in the PAH feature.
# if this is not the case then removal of the continuum from the PAH interval will be
# subject to error in the postprocessing.  This may no longer work if the continuum
# binning is changed in the continuum_mesh.dat file

#The output luminosities are Logs,so they must be linear and then the ratio:
#R=(HX-SX)/(Hx+SX) to for the swift hardness ratio
#SX and HX are abbreviations for soft X-ray and Hard x-ray.
#the first number is the energy which is almost the average of next two numbers.
#second and third numbers are lower and upper limits based on the paper. 
# The code wll report the total luminosity or flux over these bands, assuming

# As a result, the derivved hardness ratio can be use to indicate
# changes in the hardness ratio between different SEDs, and not the absolute value
