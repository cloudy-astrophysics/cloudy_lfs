         A DATABASE FOR EMISSION LINE SPECTROSCOPY

                     Version 7.1.4

CHIANTI consists of a database of atomic data and IDL procedures for
calculating spectroscopic emission line intensities from optically thin
astrophysical spectra as a function of density and temperature. 

CHIANTI includes atomic parameters such as ion level energies, ionization
potentials, spectroscopic informations, and transition rates for spontaneous 
radiative decay, electron and proton excitation and de-excitation, and
parameters for the calculation of continuum radiation.

The original paper describing the database has appeared in 1997 in Astronomy 
and Astrophysics Supplement Series, 125, 149, authored by K. P. Dere (NRL), 
E.  Landi (U. Florence), H. E. Mason (U. Cambridge), B. Monsignori Fossi
(Arcetri) and P. R. Young (U. Cambridge). Since then, CHIANTI has undergone
several major updates to include data for many more ions and physical
processes, as well as to update and to expand the data of the ions already
in the database.

With Version 7, CHIANTI includes data for new ions, as well as significant
upgrades to the data of several key Fe ions. Data for many other existing
ions have been updated or expanded. Also, a complete suite of programs 
written in Python language is released, that allows to calculate synthetic 
spectra and carry out plasma diagnostics with roughly the same level of 
functionality of the standard IDL suite of programs.

The CHIANTI database, IDL software and User Guides are distributed freely
and they are available in the Internet, at the following address:

CHIANTI is also freely distributed as part of the SolarSoft package 
(http:www.lmsal.com/solarsoft). The Python suite of programs can be found
