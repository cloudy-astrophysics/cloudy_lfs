        The effective collision strengths to singlet levels as published by Tayal ( 2004, ApJSS, 153, 581) are not in the expected ratio of the statistical weights of the lower levels, so are not correct.  We would like to thank John Raymond for pointing this out.

        The original calculation was carried out in LS coupling, and the level-resolved values were obtained with a simple algebraic transformation using the JAJOM program. The labelling of the ground configuration 3s2 3p4 3P levels was clearly inverted.  Unfortunately, the original LS calculation was lost (Tayal, priv. comm. 2016), so as a temporary fix we have swapped the labelling of levels 1,3.  The swap is however only accurate for transitions to singlet levels, so we are retaining only the levels of the ground configuration. This dataset should  be used with caution, until a new calculation becomes available.

we use PDR- temperature data from Hollenback, but Tayal may update his S
data and it should be incorporated.
