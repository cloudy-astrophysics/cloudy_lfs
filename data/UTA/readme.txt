NOTATION FOR THE OPACITY PROJECT DATA, nrb00*

These sets of inner shell transitions are from Nigel Badnell's web site
http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/tamoc/DATA/PE/

Badnell et al. (2005) describe the methods.

They were generated as part of the Seaton/Opacity Project and follow their convention.
The names designate the electron target because the R-matrix
radiative data is generated from an electron collision problem,
taken down to bound states. 

The names begin with nrb00 then the isoelectronic sequence of the next higher ion,
followed by the element.  The number after the element is related to the charge,
but think of the number 
as Roman since target electron charge = Roman recombined.

So, in this convention, data for O VI, which is Li-sequence, would be He since
that is the parent ion, followed by o6.  So,
O VI == he_o6ic1-2.dat


Data within the file:
IRSL are the (non-energy-order) levels in
   INDX  IRSL   CODE                 S L   WJ        WNR
The first column here is lower level, second upper level.

  IRSL  IRSL  N   L      DEL(RYD)       B(SEC)      R(SEC)      A(SEC):       1
B is Einstein up, R is down and A is Auger.
