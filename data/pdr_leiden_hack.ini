## turn off grain condensation of molecules
no grain molecules
##>>chng 05 jul 30 turn off collisional cooling of the gas by grains - very important in v4
## no grain gas collisional energy exchange
## make sure there is no ionized hydrogen that is due to
## anything but photoionization from
## the n=1 level at the face 
## >>chng 16 apr 14, had been case B, this gets same effect with
## no large Lyman optical depths
Database H-like Lyman pumping off
## 
## Turn off all cosmic ray ionization processes except for hydrogen and helium
set Leiden Hack Cosmic heavy off 
##
## turn off Federman chemistry
set chemistry Federman off 
##
database h-like collisional ionization off
##
## turn off grain neutralization, as it appears that is
## what the other PDR codes are doing
## Use the rates and reactions from the UMIST database 
set Leiden hack UMIST rates
no grain neutralization
## 
## bakes & tielens heating formula
set PAH Bakes 
##
## They want the intensities in terms of surface brightness
print line surface brightness
print line faint -7
set temperature convergence -2.7
stop temperature 3 linear
##
## add cosmic rays, which are important at depth
set csupra -16.64
## >>chng 12 apr 09, scale factor will result in CR rate for that meeting
cosmic rays background linear 0.1266
##
## use the H2 formation rate on grains that appears in SN99
set H2 Jura SN99
##
## use the Bertoldi & Draine rates
set H2 small model BD96 
##
set nchrg 4
set nend 2000
##
## Let's set some hacks that describe how the solomom rate
## will be plotted and when the big H2 atom will start 
## to do it's thing
set leiden hack CR off 
no grain electrons
## database H2 limit -20
##
## the observed microturbulence 
turbulence 1 km/sec
## Use grain distribution that most closely matches their value
## for the attenuation coefficient 
## turn off H2* in the chemistry since the other PDR codes
## are not considering it
##set leiden grain opacity
set leiden hack H2* off 
##
##Define the partitioning of energy for H2
set h2 grain formation pumping thermal
##
##This command lets us print smaller values for the heating and cooling rates 
set weakheatcool 0.0000001
element helium abundance -1.00  
element carbon abundance -4.00 
element oxygen abundance -3.5  
element iron        off
## Set the Nitrogen abundance to an insignificant value,
## this is done because logic in mole_co_drive will not calculate
## molecular abundances if nitrogen abundance is SMALLFLOAT
