# This file is used to print the most important data sources in the main Cloudy output
# all lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.
# all other lines are copied verbatim to the output, except that XXXX will be replaced by the actual version number.

#   DO NOT ALTER THE "XXXX" STRING!

# Be careful not add empty lines at the end since these will be copied to the output as well...

 These are some of the most important databases used by Cloudy:
 Many recombination coefficients were taken from http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/tamoc/RR/ and http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/tamoc/DR/
      and are based on the following papers:
        Badnell N. R., et al., A&A 406, 1151 (2003) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...406.1151B]
        Badnell N. R., ApJS 167, 334 (2006) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..167..334B]
 Much of the molecular emission data is from LAMDA as accessed on June 30, 2015. This database is described in:
        Schoeier F.L., et al., A&A 432, 369 (2005) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...432..369S]
      This database is in part based on the work of the following groups:
        JPL: Pickett H. M. et al., JQSRT, 60, 883 (1998). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JQSRT..60..883P]
        CDMS: Mueller H. S. et al., A&A 370, L49 (2001). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...370L..49M]
              Mueller H. S. et al., J. Mol. Struct. 742, 215 (2005). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005JMoSt.742..215M]
 Some of the ionic emission data is from version XXXX of CHIANTI. CHIANTI is a collaborative project involving the NRL (USA), the
      Universities of Florence (Italy) and Cambridge (UK), and George Mason University (USA). These papers describe Chianti:
        Dere K. P., et al., A&AS, 125, 149 (1997) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997A%26AS..125..149D]
        Landi E., et al., ApJ, 744, 99 (2012) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...744...99L]
 Much of the H_2 data is from this web site: http://molat.obspm.fr/index.php?page=pages/Molecules/H2/H2can94.php. These data are
      described in:
        Abgrall H. et al., Can. J. Phys., 72, 856 (1994) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994CaJPh..72..856A]
        Wrathmall S. A. & Flower D. R., J. Phys. B, 40, 3221 (2007) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JPhB...40.3221W]
 The Case A and Case B recombination predictions for one-electron systems are from
	Storey, P.J. & Hummer, D.G., 1995, MNRAS 272, 41 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995MNRAS.272...41S
 The He I recombination predictions are from
	Porter, R. L.; Ferland, G. J.; Storey, P. J.; Detisch, M. J., 2012, MNRAS, 425, 28p http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.425L..28P

 If you find some process or data set to be particularly critical to a result, please follow the trail of references back to the
 original source and cite that.  This will support and encourage atomic, molecular, and chemical physicists to continue their
 valuable work.
