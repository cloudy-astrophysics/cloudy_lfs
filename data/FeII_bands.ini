#
# the large FeII atom predicts far too many lines to be grasped by a human
# under most circumstances.  The bands defined in this file provide a way to
# collapse the FeII spectrum into a smaller group of lines.
#
# These bands will be entered into the main emission line 
# printout with line label "Fe2b", 
# They will have a wavelength given by the first number on the following lines.
# The second pair of numbers are bounds for summing over the 
# predicted FeII emission spectrum.
# Lines are included if their wavelengths are ge lower, le upper bounds
# these are all vacuum wavelengths 
#
# data in this file is read in by routine FeIICreate, which calls
# FeIIBandsCreate, all into is put into
# structure FeII_Bands[n][3]
# The data structure FeII is in cddrive.h
#
# The number of wavelength bands is deduced on the fly by reading this file
# and stored as FillnBands.
# There is no limit to the number of bands in this file.
#
# The first number should be entered as an integer because
# it will be converted to an
# integer in the printout.  The remaining numbers are floats.
# All numbers must be greater than 0 and the third number must be 
# larger than the second.
#
# Any line with a "#" in col 1 is a comment and totally ignored,
# These comment lines can occur anywhere within this file.
# Any line that does not have a "#" in col 1 must contain three numbers.  
#
# The file ends with end of file, and must contain comments or valid data
# up to that point
#
# the order of the bands in this file can be changed, and the 
# bands will appear in exactly this order in the standard printout
#
# these are very broad bands
