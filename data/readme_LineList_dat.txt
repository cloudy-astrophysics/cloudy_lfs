When the code is called as a subroutine of other, larger codes,
it is possible to obtain a list of emission lines by calling cdGetLineList.
The argument to that routine is the name of a file that has a list of the emission
line whose intensities can then be obtained, by calling cdLine.  
These line lists are meant to be edited and viewed by a human.  
This file describes the format of these lists of emission lines.

The actual line files can be listed with the command "ls LineList*.dat"

Comments can appear anywhere and begin with a "#" in col 1
Any of the lines can be deleted by placing a "#" in col 1

Lines that do not have a # in col 1 must contain a valid emission line
The information in cols 1-4 must be the 4-character line label as printed by the code.
This is followed by the line wavelength.  

The wavelength is in Angstroms unless the line ends with 
the character 'c' (centimeters) or 'm' (microns).  If the value is
in Angstroms and it is less than 1000A then the number is a 4-digit
floating point number.  If it is in microns or cm,
the wavelength is a 4-digit floating point number followed by 'm' or 'c'
immediately after the number.  This is the same format as the emission
line printout at the end of a calculation.  A list of line labels can be
generated by running the code with the "print line lables" command.

comments can appear after the wavelength

DANGER!
Many different lines can have the same wavelength - make sure you get the right line!
The punch line labels command can generate a complete list of all 
lines perdicted by the code.  Its output includes the line index,
a number giving the order of the line in the large stack of emision lines.
There are a vast number of emission lines predicted by the code, 
and many lines will have the same wavelength.  The line label can 
usually be used to distinguish between various lines with 
the same wavelength. This is seldom the case for contributions 
to the line however.  For instance, the label "inwd" is applied to the inward 
contribution to all lines, so there are almost certainly many 
lines with this label and the same wavelength.  The line index 
can be used to break this degeneracy in cases where you want to 
obtain a line's intensity with a call to a routine.  Routine cdLine_ip 
uses this index to find the relative intensity and luminosity of a 
line with a particular index.  But note that this index is not 
a constant - it will always be the same for a particular set of 
input conditions, but it depends on the sizes of various atoms 
and which elements are turned on.
