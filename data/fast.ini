##
## this ini file makes the code as fast as possible, at the expense
## of some loss of fidelity and stability.  The options are done
## with low density nebulae in mind.  The file was developed to
## aid in testing the code in the dynamics case, and the
## approximations are probably ok for that application.
## this file should not be included in any results intended for publication.

## this does not turn on grains - 
## to turn on the very fastest grains, at the expense of the physics, do
## grains single no qheat no physics

print off hide 
## include only elements with significant gas-phase abundances
## when grains are present - note, this does not include
## grains, which must be added separately
##
## following turns off level2 lines, mostly weak and x-ray resonance lines
no level2

# options to speed things up at lot, at the cost of a poor simulation
no opacity reevaluation
no ionization reevaluation
no grain physics
no line transfer

## the intensities predicted by the very small H atom are pretty bad
## much better to use case b as the normalizing line
## the SH case b are only predicted when physical conditions are within
## range of their table.  This old case b is not as accurate but
## is always predicted
