\section{The Chemistry command}

Several chemistry sub-commands can be specified on a single line,
separated by commas, e.g.

\cdCommand{chemistry reaction ``$\mathbf{S+,Mg=>S,Mg+}$'' off, reaction ``$\mathbf{S+,Fe=>S,Fe+}$'' off}

\subsection{Chemistry reaction}

The keyword \cdCommand{reaction} takes a string argument for the
reaction which is being referred to.  Care is taken to ensure that the
effect of this command does not depend on the order in which reactants
or products are specified.

At present, it has a single option, \cdCommand{off}, which disables
the reaction.

A list of reactions can be specified for the command, i.e.

\cdCommand{chemistry reaction (``$\mathbf{S+,Mg=>S,Mg+}$'', ``$\mathbf{S+,Fe=>S,Fe+}$'') off}

The brackets, and commas between entries, are required.
