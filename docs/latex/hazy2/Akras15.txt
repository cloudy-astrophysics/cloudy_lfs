Dear Prof. Gary J. Ferland,

Of course you can use the figure. I have no problem at all. On the contrary, it will be my pleasure to see this figure in the Cloudy documentation.
Please fell free to use it

Your Sincerely,

Stavros Akras

Dear Dr Akras,
I would like to use Figure 17 of your paper MNRAS 452, 2911–2929 (2015) on the cover of Hazy 2 in the next release of Cloudy.  I think we have everything we would need, and will certainly properly reference your original paper.  I hope this meets with your approval.
all the best,
Gary Ferland
