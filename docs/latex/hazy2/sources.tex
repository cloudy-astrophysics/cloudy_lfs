\chapter{ATOMIC DATA SOURCES}
% !TEX root = hazy2.tex

Codes like \Cloudy\ can only exist because of the large body of work 
done by the atomic and molecular physics community.
This work will only continue
to be supported if it is cited in the literature whenever it is used.
The
following is a partial list of citations for the atomic data used within
the code.

This table is generated by the perl script \cdFilename{doc\_atomic\_data.pl}.
This generates the file \cdFilename{doc\_atomic\_data\_refer.txt}
which is pasted below.
