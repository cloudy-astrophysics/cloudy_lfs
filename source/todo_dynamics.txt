orion flow does not go deep enough to fully form CO, so advective effects not fully tested
	increase N(H) by at least 2x to form CO

add test on conservation of C or O - test numbers coming in from upstream 

CO cross terms in H chem are turned off when advection is done

momle_h_step cross terms with co network turned off when advection is on - it not done the extensive printout due to non-conservations of protons

mole_h_step.c - start line 4554, large block of reactions that are not used - rm these also from global name space - second block at 5278 - used these source and sink terms in bvec, also commented out

pressure_total.c - line 710, EnthalphDensity cp vs cd cases - now set to get cd answer

when co block of reactions is commented out in hmole dynamics very large residual in H sum new vs old at very start of second and later iteration  is almost certainly caused by dense.H_sum_in_CO not being right.- needs to be reset to zero 

dynamics_orion_flow - co chem explicitly turned off in test script 

======================
time dep

constant pressure, time dep, conflict, 
	last command will have effect, overwriting previous
	first iteration will not be constant 
	in change pressure - logic should allow constant pressure on first iter, use dynamics after
