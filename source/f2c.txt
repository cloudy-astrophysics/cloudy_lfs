Conversion from Fortran to C using Cobalt Blue Tools

moved c:\u\cblue dir to c:\u\cbluebak so that chkdsk will run

===========================================================
fstruct

converts F66/77 to F90, with enddo, break, etc

fstruct filename 
filename.for ==> filename.f
fstruct filename.for (writes filename.f)
                     (filename.f writes filename.fs)

initialization file is 
fstruct.cfg in cblue dir

===========================================================
forc

converts F77 to ansi c

configuration file is forc.cfg in cblue subdir

doc is fctutor.doc in cblue subdir

first make prototypes:

-PRO - make prototypes
-PRO=f (best) make prototypes based on functions themselves, 
       then necessary to call several times to get prototypes right
-PF=name.h specify different prototype name, default is project.h
