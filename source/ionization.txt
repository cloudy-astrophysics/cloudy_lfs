ionization balance is set up in series of IonElementname routines.

these are called by ionize

===========================================
in each IonElementname routine

ion_zero zeroes out the balance array

===========================================

Photoionization is evaluated in two routines, iso_photo and photoionize

ionization and recombination arrays
ionbal.PhotoRate_Ground[nelem][nion][ns][0] photo rate for shell ns
ionbal.PhotoRate_Ground[nelem][nion][ns][1] heating rate for same shell, not causing sec ion
ionbal.PhotoRate_Ground[nelem][nion][ns][2] heating that can sec ion

bound electron compton scattering
evaluated in highen, should be added only to ground state photo and heat rates
ionization rate per atom, is added to PhotoRate_Ground
ionbal.CompRecoilIonRate[nelem][ion]
heating rate, is secondary-capable heating, should be added to high-energy heating
ionbal.CompRecoilHeatRate[nelem][ion]

collisional ionization 
ionbal.CollIonRate_Ground[nelem][ion][0] is collisional ionization rate
ionbal.CollIonRate_Ground[nelem][ion][1] is cooling due to this

ion_recomb
fills in recombination array
RecomRate.RecombinRate[ion][NELEM-1]

===================================================

ion_solver

to print photo ion rates for all shells of an ion and element
GammaPrtRate(
	/* io unit we will write to */
	FILE * ioFILE, 
	/* stage of ionization on C scale, 0 for atom */
	long int ion ,
	/* 0 for H, etc */
	long int ipZ)

===================================================

charge transfer

everthing is in chargtran.c and atmdat.h

with hydrogen evaluated in atmdat

this is the charge ionization, recom array that goes into the ionization balance
[0][ion] is ionization, 
[1][ion] is recombination 
this has all charge transfer rates 
EXCEPT those for hydrogen those are in HCharExcIon and HCharExcRec

CharExc.CTHeavy[direction][species]
