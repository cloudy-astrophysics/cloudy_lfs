temperature is converged when thermal.htot and thermal.ctot have a relative
error that is smaller than conv.HeatCoolRelErrorAllowed

conv.HeatCoolRelErrorAllowed is reset with set temperature error command

function lgConvTemp() returns true is heating cooling is converged

conv.lgConvTemp true if converged

heating cooling arrays

local heating thermal.htot
local cooling thermal.ctot

===================================================================

heating - main array 
HeatingCom.heating[ipZ][ipZ]
sumed in heatsum
punched in heatpunch.f

===================================================================

cooling
located in thermal.h
4-char line labels stored in char*5 chCoolants.chClntLab[i]
thermal.collam[i] is the wavelength
thermal.cooling[i] is the actual cooling
thermal.heatnt[i] contains coolant that acutally heats (negative cooling)

CoolAdd - the cooling array is filled with coolants by calling routine CoolAdd by routines that
	do level populations and spectrum

CoolSum - all cooling added together in CoolSum
