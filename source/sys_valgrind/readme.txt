This directory contains the files needed to generate
an O3 optimized executable with g++ that can be used with valgrind

it includes the option -DNOINIT

===========================

run valgrind with option --leak-check=full as in
valgrind --leak-check=full ./cloudy.exe < test.in > test.out

The default setup in this directory will use the g++ compiler.
To use a different compiler, add a line like the following to 
the file Makefile.conf in this directory:
CXX = icc
This example would use the Intel compiler.

===========================

if you receive the error
#error "This g++ version cannot compile Cloudy and must not be used!"
it is because you have version 2.96 or 3.4 of g++.  These versions cannot
produce a valid executable.  Update to a more recent version of the compiler.
