most is in input.h / input.cpp
the number of input lines is unlimited since stored in a vector

maximum line length is
INPUT_LINE_LENGTH is set to 2000 in cddefines.h

cdRead routine to read in command lines and enter into command stack 
 called by user when cloudy used as subroutine 
 called by cdMain and ParseInit when used as standalone program

certain characters define comments that can start at the beginning of a line
or after a command, and that run until the end of the line
the logic for this is in the routine lgIsCommentSeq

empty lines or a field of stars define the end of the input
anything after such a sentinel is ignored
the logic for this is in the routine lgInputEOF

before an input line is stored, invisible comments (i.e. comments that are
not echoed to output) are stripped, as well as the end-of-line character
furthermore, underscores and square brackets are replaced by spaces
this is done by the routine StripComment

input.readarray is used to expose the next input line to the parser

any further processing of the input line is done by the parser
