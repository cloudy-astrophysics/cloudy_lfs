wind changes speed at pressure_change.cpp

radiative acceleration 

developed in collaboration with Robin Williams, Will Henney, & Jane Arthur

all code is within dynamics.c

ionization recombination terms:
ionization adds term dynamics.Photo
recombination adds term dynamics.Recomb[nelem][ion]

thermal effects added
cooling - dynamics.CoolHeat
it deriv dynamics.dCoolHeatdT

all energy terms boil down to
EnergyInternal = phycon.EnergyExcitation + phycon.EnergyIonization + phycon.EnergyBinding;
these are evaluated in pressuretotal

/*TODO this is the molecular binding energy (?) not set to anything */
phycon.EnergyBinding = 0.;
