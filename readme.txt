Distribution files for Cloudy
www.nublado.org

There are seven directories below this one containing the atomic data, documentation, doxygen setup files, a unit test library, some helpful scripts, the source, and test suite.  The test suite directory, tsuite, has a number of directories below it, giving parts of the test suite.  

These directories contain all files needed to build and execute Cloudy.  Each directory has a readme file giving more information on the contents.  It is important to maintain this directory structure when the download is opened on your computer.

DOCUMENTS
The docs directory contains PDF versions of the documentation.  The doxygen directory contains the files needed to create html documentation with doxygen.  See the readme for more details.
